![🚚Transport_Layer_Part_2 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d4f752a-2854-4252-a9e8-b50d95491e37)

## 📌 Introduction

This repository was developed to support an application-based Python seminar that tackles the TCP/IP model's transport layer. As a result of improving TCP-based client-server applications, you will be applying the core networking principles that you were introduced to during the workshop.By the end of this project, participants would have worked with API data and adopted simple TCP connectivity alongside considered encryption methods that secure network interactions.

## 📝 Exercises Overview

- Recognising the primary purpose of TCP within the transport layer (error recovery, flow control, in addition to connection management). 
- TCP and UDP have distinctive characteristics in application scenarios. 
- Python execution of TCP communication between client and server systems. 
- Implementing threading to manage a variety of client connections at the same time. 
- Through the use of an API connection to easily access and pass on weather data.
- Encryption of information for maximum security.

## 🚀 Installation and Usage

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

- Required Python libraries:

```pip install cryptography requests ```

- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm) or terminal.
